# Introduction

The advancement in technology has made it easier for misinformation to spread not only further but faster. This trajectory of misleading facts has become something that many self-proclaimed journalist and experts have made their career on, even leading to success in presidential elections. Fake New was a term made popular during the 2016 election that still has profound effects on the media today. The question becomes which new stations are people trusting to give them information and are these sites giving factual information? The distrust in media that boomed during 2016 has made the easy access to digital media breeding ground for misinformation. A study done in 2020 (1) on the media consumption of Americans have found that a 20% of both Democrats and Republicans form a bubble of news outlets and rarely traverse outside of it. It also shows that Democrats are more likely to trust than distrust news sources. Another Study published in 2021 collected data from a survey asking participants their definition of fake news, propaganda, real news, and their rating of 42 different news sources based on these definitions. They found that political affiliation might influence perceptions of trustworthiness.

## Research Questions

-   This raises the questions what effect does the amount of time spent consuming news have on perceptions of trustworthiness of news stations?

-   How does this relationship effect voter turnout for those who voted outside their party for the 2016 election?

## Hypotheses

-   Individuals that spend more time consuming news media will a have higher ratings in the Real News category compared to those who spend less time consuming news media
-   An individual's trust in news outlets had a moderating effect on voting choice causing an individual to vote for a candidate whose political views oppose theirs.( News trust moderating the voters choice)

# Description

This data set consists of 293 responses to a survey that asked how familiar a participants was with the news sources presented (there were 42 different new sources asked about in this survey). Along with how familiar they were with these news sources and to rank them 3 categories Fake News, Propaganda, and Real news. Next they were ask for their political Id which was converted to left, right, and center based on their response. Participants were also asked how much time they spent consuming news media per day and who they voted for in the 2016 presidential election

```{r}
fakenews <- read.csv("FakeNews.csv")
paged_table(head(fakenews))
```

I will focus on 6 variables **Pol_split**, **vote_2016**, **REAL_avg**, **FAKE_avg**,and **news_time** I moved the variables that I wanted to the front of the data frame and then subset them so that I would only be dealing with these variables. The **ID** variable is irrelevant just noting the placement of the participant in the data frame. It's also important to note that during participants were asked to give every news sources Propaganda, Fake news and Real news. I will be using the Average of these scores to identify an individual trusts in the media.

Rating Scale

-   1 = Definitely not

-   2 = Probably not

-   3 = Might or might not be

-   4 = probably is

-   5 = definitely is

    Using 3 as the center point (neutral zone) an average of less than 3 is against the categorization and anything greater than 3 is for the categorization.

```{r}
fakenews <- relocate(fakenews, Pol_split, .after = sex)
fakenews <- relocate(fakenews, vote_2016, .after = Pol_split) 
fakenews <- relocate(fakenews, REAL_avg, .after = vote_2016)
fakenews <- relocate(fakenews, FAKE_avg, .after = REAL_avg) 
fakenews <- relocate(fakenews, news_time, .after = FAKE_avg)
fakenews_recoded <- fakenews[,1:7]
head(fakenews_recoded)
```

```{r}
fakenews_recoded <- fakenews_recoded %>% mutate(switch = case_when(Pol_split == "Right" & vote_2016 == "Clinton" ~ 1, Pol_split == "Left" & vote_2016 == "Trump" ~ 1, TRUE ~ 0) )
fakenews_recoded <- fakenews_recoded %>% mutate(independent = case_when(Pol_split == "Center" ~ 1, TRUE ~ 0) )
fakenews_recoded <- relocate(fakenews_recoded, independent, .after = vote_2016)
head(fakenews_recoded, 14)
```

-   **Age**

    -   Age of participant

-   **Sex**

    -   1 for Male

    -   2 for Female

-   **Pol_Split**

    -   1-3 = Left

    -   4 = Center

    -   5-7 = Right

-   **news_time**

    -   1 = Fewer than 30minutes

    -   2 = Between 30min and 1 hour

    -   3 = Between 1 - 2 hours

    -   4 = More than 2 hours

-   **REAL_Avg**

    -   Average of Real news ratings

-   **FAKE_AVG**

    -   Average of Fake news rating

-   **Switch**

    -   Outside of Party vote: Left voted for Trump, Right voted for Clinton

-   **Independent**

    -   center voters can vote for either party, so to keep this constant I will be controlling for Independent, which i denoted using a 1 for center or a 0 for left/right.

# Hypothesis Testing

-   ***Hypothesis 1***
    -   For My first Hypothesis I will use Multivariate Linear regression. My explanatory variables will be news time and pol-split and my outcome variable will be will be FAKE_avg, and Real_avg. I will also Run this regression controlling for pol-split, and also with the interaction of pol split with news_Time in case political ideology contributes to how much news a person consumes.

```{r}
##This is a combine overview of each model, I combined Fake_avg & Real Avg, to visually compare the models to each other, as a whole. This is the same results as running them separately 2 time each, just condensed to 4 times grouped
overview1<-lm(cbind(FAKE_avg,REAL_avg)~ news_time, data=fakenews_recoded)
overview2<-lm(cbind(FAKE_avg,REAL_avg)~ news_time+Pol_split, data=fakenews_recoded)
overview3 <-lm(cbind(FAKE_avg,REAL_avg)~news_time*Pol_split, data=fakenews_recoded)
overview4 <-lm(cbind(FAKE_avg,REAL_avg)~ news_time+Pol_split +news_time*Pol_split, data=fakenews_recoded)
```

***Model 1 Overview:*** Fake_Avg & Real_avg against news_time

```{r}
summary(overview1)
```

***Model 2 Overview:*** Fake_Avg & Real_avg against news_time and Pol_split (political Ideology)

```{r}
summary(overview2)
```

***Model 3 Overview:*** Fake_Avg & Real_avg against news_time \* Pol_split (political Ideology) Interaction

```{r}
summary(overview3)
```

***Model 4 Overview:*** Fake_Avg & Real_avg against news_time, Pol_split (political Ideology) and News_time \* Pol_split Interaction

```{r}
summary(overview4)
```

***Individual Models:*** Instead of combining the FAKE_avg and REAL_avg DV, I ran them separately using the four models, Giving me 8 models (a Fake_avg and Real_avg regression for each of the four models). This was so that I could compare the AIC,BIC,and ADJUSTED-R.squared visually in a table, these are the same results as in the combined over view, however we can see how each model performed for each DV. With A standing for FAKE_avg and B standing for REAL_avg. So model 1a would be model 1 with FAKE_Avg as the DV and model 1b would be model 1 with REAL_avg as the DV.

```{r}
## These are the individual models, I ran the Same four models, one with Fake_avg & one with Real_avg
Hypo1_Model1a <- glm(FAKE_avg~ news_time, data=fakenews_recoded)
Hypo1_Model2a <- glm(FAKE_avg~ news_time+Pol_split, data=fakenews_recoded)
Hypo1_Model3a <- glm(FAKE_avg~news_time*Pol_split, data=fakenews_recoded)
Hypo1_Model4a <- glm(FAKE_avg~ news_time+Pol_split +news_time*Pol_split, data=fakenews_recoded)
Hypo1_Model1b <- glm(REAL_avg~ news_time, data=fakenews_recoded)
Hypo1_Model2b <- glm(REAL_avg~ news_time+Pol_split, data=fakenews_recoded)
Hypo1_Model3b <- glm(REAL_avg~news_time*Pol_split, data=fakenews_recoded)
Hypo1_Model4b <- glm(REAL_avg~ news_time+Pol_split +news_time*Pol_split, data=fakenews_recoded)
```

***TABLE:***

*For **Model 2 both A&B** as I want to make sure that the terms are the same for both DVs. The ACI & BIC are smaller than Model 3/4 which performed the same. They Adjusted R square is also larger than all the others. Model 1 has the highest BIC/AIC and lowest Adjusted R squared.*

-   ***Hypothesis 2*** - For my second Hypothesis, my explanatory variables will, FAKE_AVG, REAL_AVG, My dependent variable will be my created variable Switch, to see if there is correlation with news trust and vote switching.

# Conclusion

-   **Hypothesis 1**

    When investigating the relationship between and individuals distrust in news and the time they spend consuming news media I found that time consumption had a negative correlation with distrust in news (FAKE_avg) per 1 unit increase in new consumption time(news_time) there was -0.23704 decrease in their average distrust score. I also found a positive corelation between distrust in news and individuals politically alligned with the right, causing a 0.49 addition to the score per 1 unit increase in news_times.Suggesting that while news time does effect trust in media, pollitical affiliation as a larger impact. With both of these vairables being statistically significant with p-values less than 0.001 I can reject the null hypothesis infavor of the alternative hypothesis which is that news trust does have an effect on news distrust. However when analysising the realtionship between news time and trust news time was not stastically significant meaning I fail to reject the null hypothesis which that time spent consuming news has no effect on the perception of real news. Surprsingly when investgating specifically the real news averages, poltical affiliation was stastically signficant instead of news consumption time. Left leaning indiivduals saw a -0.28286 decrease for a 1 unit increase in REAL_avg on the other hand Right leaning indiivudals experiences a 0.24327 increase in their scores for per 1 unit increase in REAL_avg. Showing that once again political Affliation has a larger impact on trust in news media.

-   **Hypothesis 2**

    After running a casual mediation analysis I fail to reject the null hypothesis as there is no evidence of significants for Indirect effect (AMC) on REAL_avg or FAKE_avg. Which tells us there is no proof of news time meidating the relationship between news trust and opposite party candiate votes.
