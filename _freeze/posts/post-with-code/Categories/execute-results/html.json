In these directed graphs the in-degree and out-degrees mean the following.\n\nin-degrees - the node is influenced by the node that is pointing at it.\n\nout-degree - this node is has an influence on the node it is pointing to.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nV(cg.ig)$role <- cg_mod$block.membership[match(V(cg.ig)$name, cg_mod$plabels)]\nV(cg.ig)$category <- names.attr$category\n# Create an empty list to store subgraphs\ncg.subgraphs <- list()\n\n# Loop through each role and create a subgraph\nfor (i in 1:9) {\n  # Get the nodes for the current role\n  role_nodes <- which(cg.stat %v% \"role\" == i)\n  cat_nodes <- which(cg.stat %v% \"category\" == i)\n  \n  # Extract the subgraph for the current role\n  cg.subgraphs[[i]] <- induced_subgraph(cg.ig, vids = role_nodes)\n   V(cg.subgraphs[[i]])$node_names <- V(cg.ig)$role[role_nodes]\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Power Dynamics\n\nTopics related to the exertion, distribution, and dynamics of power in society, politics, and economics. This category encompasses topics such as imperialism, racism, colonization, capitalism, and other forms of power dynamics.\n\n**Imperialism** is the node with the most influence, as it has the strongest out degree.\n\n**Colonization** is the most influenced, as it has the strongest in degree.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(cg.subgraphs[[1]], layout = layout_with_fr(cg.subgraphs[[1]]), \n     main = \"Power Dynamics\",\n     vertex.label.color = \"black\", vertex.label.family = \"sans\",\n     vertex.label.dist = 1.5, edge.width = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Categories_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Social Infrastructure\n\nTopics related to the foundational elements of society that support its functioning, including housing, education, infrastructure, and criminal justice.\n\nFor this category **Housing** is the overarching concept, affecting the other three nodes. What's also interesting is that Housing had the highest rating as a problem in the United States\n\n**Criminal Justice** has the highest in-degree being influenced by all other concepts.\n\n\n:::
